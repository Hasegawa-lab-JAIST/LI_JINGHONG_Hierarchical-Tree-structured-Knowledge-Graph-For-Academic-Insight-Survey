0,263908862,Idea2Img: Iterative Self-Refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for Automatic Image Design and Generation,limitation and discussion,Insight-tree,"tasks beyond image generation. idea2img explores the emergent ability of multimodal self-refinement in lmmbased systems, through the image design and generation task. specifically, idea2img views the t2i model to use as an unknown multimodal environment to explore, and iteratively refines t2i prompts to find its optimal usage. this concept mirrors the intrinsic human approach of iterative problem-solving when faced with unknown environments or complex challenges. we leave its extension to other intriguing tasks [48], e.g., gui navigation, embodied agents, and complicated visual reasoning, for future exploration. from a single image generation model to multiple tools. idea2img explores the usage of a single image generation model, including a text-to-image model [34] or a textconditioned image-to-image model [24]. when needed, other specialized generative models like controlnet [56], inpainting [4], region-controlled t2i generation [21,51], customized generation [8,35], and video generation [42,53] can be seamlessly switched as replacements. that is, idea2img could broadly boost different image generation models with diverse specialties by exploring their optimal text description or instruction prompts.beyond a single generation model, idea2img can also be used to allocate multiple tools as in multimodal agent studies [45,49]. in this case, idea2img isn't limited to optimizing the use of individual tools but also investigates their effective collaboration when used together, such as generator selection and multi-step visual generation. consolidating explored knowledge. we have shown the effectiveness of lmm iterative self-refinement in automatic image design and generation. going beyond merely preserving the probed t2i model's properties in memory, idea2img can also help to consolidate or distill the explored knowledge into t2i model parameters, such that no inference-time iterative refinement is needed when encountering similar generation scenarios. for example, one could collect a dataset using idea2img for a scenario of interest, and fine-tune a t2i model with the explored selfrefinement trajectory. storing the probed knowledge as sample-agnostic prompt for each image generation model is another promising direction [14,32,57].",{},https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08541v1.pdf

9,263609132,LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS CANNOT SELF-CORRECT REASONING YET,limitations and broader impact,Insight-tree,"although our exploration spans a variety of self-correction strategies, prompts, and tasks, as we mentioned earlier, it is plausible that there exist specific prompts or strategies that could enhance the reasoning performance of models for particular benchmarks.however, searching such prompts or strategies may inadvertently rely on external feedback, either from human insights or training data.additionally, such search efforts can be equally applied to the pre-hoc prompts (zhou et al., 2022;yang et al., 2023).a potential outcome of our study might be that it discourages research into self-correction for certain applications.nonetheless, we are optimistic that our findings will steer future research towards more practical applications of self-correction, especially those where tangible benefits can be derived, potentially by leveraging external feedback.furthermore, several related works have already presented findings consistent with our observation: that self-correction, when devoid of external feedback, serves as a relatively weak baseline (gou et al., 2023;zhou et al., 2023a).despite this, we have identified a prevailing ambiguity in the wider community, with even domain experts being uncertain about the intricacies of when and how selfcorrection operates.some existing literature may inadvertently contribute to this confusion, either by relegating crucial details about label usage to less prominent sections or by failing to clarify that their designed self-correction strategies actually incorporate external feedback.our intention in this paper is to amplify these concerns and offer a comprehensive overview of the state of ""selfcorrection"" in llms.the title, ""large language models cannot self-correct reasoning yet"", is not an outright dismissal of self-correction techniques.instead, it serves as a call to action, urging researchers to approach this domain with a discerning and critical perspective.furthermore, it encourages future research to explore approaches that can genuinely enhance reasoning.for the sake of clarity, we recommend omitting the term ""self"" from concepts like self-correction or selfcritique when the context does not strictly adhere to an intrinsic self-correction setting and adopting less confusing terms like ""correction with external tools/feedback"".finally, in light of our findings that llms struggle to self-correct reasoning based purely on their inherent capabilities, we urge a more circumspect view on any unwarranted optimism (or fear) regarding the autonomous evolution of llms (and ai systems) through self-improvement.","{258833055: 'Shinn et al. 2023', 247595263: 'Wang et al., 2022;', 52822214: 'Yang et al., 2018'}",https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01798v1.pdf

(2020) and mahabadi et al. (2020). we show that knowledge distillation, modeling multiple biases at once, and weighting the impact of each bias based on its strength in the training data are all important factors in improving the in-domain and out-of-domain performances. while recent literature on debiasing in nlp focuses on improving the performance on adversarial evaluation sets, this work opens new research directions on wider uses of debiasing methods. the main advantage of using our debiasing methods is that they improve the performance and generalization without requiring additional training data or larger models. future work could build upon our framework by applying it to a wide range of tasks beyond qa using task-specific bias models.","{202539031: 'Clark et al., 2019;', 86611921: 'Kwiatkowski et al., 2019', 208000835: 'Su et al. 2019', 208201969: 'Sugawara et al., 2020', 173188058: 'Talmor and Berant 2019', 52822214: 'Yang et al., 2018'}",https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.74.pdf

88,263334529,Towards LLM-based Fact Verification on News Claims with a Hierarchical Step-by-Step Prompting Method,limitations,Insight-tree,"despite the promising performance of llms based on few-shot icl, fact verification is a challenging research problem given the fact that performance scores are still quite low in general.there are a few limitations.firstly, in this work, we highlight that all the baselines and our proposed method solely rely on textual information.we focus on an unimodal approach utilizing language models and do not consider the potential assistance from other modalities, such as images and videos, for this task.although the exploration of multimodal approaches has gradually drawn some research attention (wang et al., 2018;silva et al., 2021;bu et al., 2023), it falls outside the scope of our current work.meanwhile, the scope of this study is limited to the verification of news claims, which represents only a subset of the broader issue of misinformation.misinformation encompasses a wide range of false or misleading information, including rumors, fake news articles, and spams (wu et al., 2019).while our focus was specifically on news claims, future research could explore the detection and mitigation of misinformation in other formats.further, our proposed prompting method heavily relies on the capabilities of backbone llms, which can come with substantial computational costs.our method leverages the advancements in multi-step reasoning exhibited by these llms, necessitating high-performance expectations.however, it is worth noting that most state-of-the-art llms are currently not open-source and only available as services.for instance, gpt-3.5 can only be accessed via api.the reliance on such llms makes deep model control infeasible, and the need for api access poses challenges in terms of cost.finally, while our approach leverages search engines to mitigate the fact hallucination issue in llms, it operates under the assumption that pertinent information is readily accessible through web search.however, not all information is indexed or available in search engines.for instance, if someone claims to have witnessed a rare meteorological phenomenon in a small town, such event might not be reported on major news websites or databases.such firsthand, non-digitized accounts might be retrieved or fact-checked.this underscores the limitation in relying solely on search engines as a primary source of external knowledge for factchecking with llms.another limitation of our method lies in the claims that are beyond established world knowledge when necessary relevant knowledge is not complete or even not available.this necessitates the model's ability to infer novel knowledge by formulating and subsequently validating appropriate hypotheses, a task that remains beyond the capabilities of existing technologies.","{226262339: 'Fan et al., 2020', 246652372: 'Ji et al., 2023;', 52822214: 'Yang et al., 2018'}",https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00305v1.pdf

413,118587388,Searching for an Attractive Force in Holographic Nuclear Physics,limitations of the n c → ∞ limit and holography,Insight-tree,"the large n c limit is inherent in all holographic qcd methods, and this poses a problem for the aspects of nuclear physics that are different between the small n c and the large n c regimes. in particular, the bulk nuclear matter at zero temperature and pressure (but finite density) forms a quantum liquid for small n c -such as real-life n c = 3 -but becomes a crystalline solid for large n c .to see how this works, consider a condensed matter analogy -some atoms which attract to each other at long or medium distances but have repulsive hard cores. semi-classically, at zero temperature and pressure such atoms always form some kind of a crystal; it takes strong quantum effects to put the atoms into some other phase such as liquid or super-solid.of particular importance is the kinetic energy of the zero-point quantum motion of atoms confined to narrow potential wells,k ∼ π 2 2 2m atom (well diameter) 2 ,(2.1)or rather its ratio k/u to the potential binding energy u per atom. according to newton bernardes [18], this ratio is related to the de bour parameter λ b of the inter-atomic potential ask u ≈ 11λ 2 b , λ b = r c √ 2mǫ , (2.2)where r c is the radius of the atomic hard core and ǫ is the maximal depth of the potential. for small de bour parameters, the quantum corrections to the semi-classical approximation are weak and the crystal remains stable at zero pressure. for larger λ b , the quantum corrections due to kinetic energy become important, and when λ b exceeds a critical value somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3 [19], the crystal melts into a quantum liquid. 4 for example, helium atoms have λ b = 0.306 and hence k/u ≈ 1 while neon atoms have λ b = 0.063 and hence k/u ≈ 0.05; consequently, at zero temperature and zero pressure helium is a quantum liquid while neon is a crystalline solid.to see how the k/u ratio of the nuclear matter depends on the number of colors, we note that in the large n c limit, the leading nuclear forces are proportional to n c . specifically, according to kaplan and manohar [20],v ( r, i 1 , i 2 , j 2 , j 2 ; n c ) = n c × a c (r) + n c × a s (r)(i 1 i 2 )(j 1 j 2 ) + n c × a t (r)(i 1 i 2 ) 3(nj 1 )(nj 2 ) − (j 1 j 2 ) (2.3) + o(1/n c ).for the same n c -independent radial profiles a c , a s , a t of the central, spin-spin, and tensor potentials. classically, such potentials would like to arrange a many-nucleon system in some kind of a crystal with n c -independent nearest-neighbor distance ∼ 1 fm, while the binding energy of a nucleon in such a crystal would be proportional to the n c . indeed, all models of nuclear matter based on semi-classical models of nucleons form such crystals, for example skyrmion crystals of ref. [6]. in the quantum theory, nucleons in such a lattice have zeropoint kinetic energies (2.1) where the well diameter is independent on n c while the nucleon's mass m ∝ n c , hence k ∝ 1/n c andk u ∝ n −1 c n +1 c = 1 n 2 c . (2.4)we may estimate the coefficient of this proportionality using the de bour parameter λ b . the maximal depth of the central potential between two nucleons is about 100 mev for n c = 3, so we take it to be ǫ ∼ n c × 30 mev for large n c . likewise, we take the nucleon mass to be m n ∼ n c × 300 mev and hard-core radius r c ∼ 0.7 fm regardless of n c . consequently,λ b = r c √ 2mǫ ∼ 2 n c =⇒ k u ∼ 45 n 2 c (2.5)and hence liquid nuclear matter for n c 8 and solid nuclear matter for n c 8.the numerical coefficient in eq. (2.5) and hence our estimate n crit c ∼ 8 for the dividing line between liquid and solid bulk nuclear matter (at low pressures and temperatures) should be taken with a large grain of salt. also, the transition between liquid nuclear matter for n c = 3 and crystalline nuclear matter for large n c may go through some exotic phases at intermediate values of n c , perhaps something like a quantum supersolid, perhaps something more exotic without known condensed-matter analogues. but regardless of the details of this transition, in the large n c limit the potential energy of interacting near-static nucleons becomes much larger than the nucleons' kinetic energies, and the bulk nuclear matter at t = 0, p = 0 conditions becomes a conventional semi-classical crystal. the structure of such crystals can be modeled holographically -and indeed there is active research in this direction (for instance [7]) -but we have no experimental data to compare to the models because real-life nuclei with n c = 3 are liquid rather than solid.meanwhile, instead of trying do build holographic models of complete nuclei we focus on holographic models of the nuclear forces. but even at the level of the two-body forces, the large n c limit maybe different from the real-life case of just 3 colors. of particular concern is the isoscalar attractive force due to exchanges of the σ(600) scalar mesons between the nucleons. in real life, this is a major component of the net attractive force -especially at the medium-long distances between the nucleons -but in the large n c limit this component may weaken or disappear because the σ(600) meson itself may become heavier or even disappear from the scalar meson spectrum.the σ(600) (also known as f 0 (600)) is the lightest isoscalar true-scalar meson. in real life, it appears as a very broad resonance of two pions -so broad that its central mass is somewhat controversial and different experimentalists locate it anywhere between 400 mev and 700 mev, and sometimes even higher, cf. references in the particle data group's listing [21]. but the real controversy about the σ(600) resonance is its physical origin. unlike the heavier i g = 0 + , j cp = 0 ++ mesons f 0 (980), f 0 (1370), etc., the σ(600) meson does not exist in the non-relativistic quark model 5 so for many years r. l. jaffe and others [22,23,24,25] were claiming that the σ(600) is not a true qq meson but a qqqq tetraquark. specifically, it's a molecule-like bound state of two pions which exists because the ρ-meson exchanges in the t-channel induce an attractive s-channel force between the pions. if this claim is true, then the σ resonance goes away in the large n c limit because the forces between pions become weak as 1/n c . but many other authors (see [26] for a sample) identify the σ(600) with the σ field of the linear sigma model of the chiral symmetry breaking. or rather, the massive σ(x) field parametrizing fluctuations of magnitude of the symmetry-breaking vev ψψ gives rise to primordial sigma quanta, while the real sigma mesons σ(600) are quantum mixtures of those primordial quanta with the |ππ states (and to lesser extent with the other i g = 0 + , j p c = 0 ++ mesons). from this point of view, the non-relativistic quark model is irrelevant because the quarks do not become non-relativistic until after the chiral symmetry has already been broken. indeed, the nrqm does not see that the pions are (pseudo) goldstone bosons, so the fact that it does not see the sigma meson at all is simply another limitation of the nrqm as far as the chiral symmetry breaking is concerned. if this point of view is right, then the sigma meson exits for all n c . for large n c limit, this meson is mostly a quantum of the σ(x) field -its mixing with |ππ and other states becomes weak -and it's a narrow resonance rather than a broad hump we have for n c = 3, but it remains a dominant resonance in the i g = 0 + , j p c = 0 ++ ππ channel, and its mass should not be too different from the real-life 600 mev.the other mesons -scalar or vector, isoscalar or isovector -are unlikely to be disturbed by the large n c limit, so their contributions to the nuclear forces would be similar to real-life qcd. if the σ(600) meson remains in the spectrum in the large n c limit and if its mass remains similar to the real-life 600 mev, then the entire nuclear potential (2.3) for n c → ∞ would be similar to what it is in real life, except for the overall factor n c . in particular, the net central potential v c (r) would be repulsive at short distances (the hard core) but 5 in the non-relativistic quark model, all 0 ++ mesons have s = 1 and l = 1. consequently, the lightest 0 ++ meson should be heavier than the lightest 1 −− mesons ρ(770) or ω(787) that have s = 1 but l = 0. depending on the assumptions one makes about the forces between the quark and the antiquark, this argument identifies the lightest true qq meson with i g = 0 + and j p c = 0 ++ as either f 0 (980) or f 0 (1370). in any case, the σ(600) resonance is way too light to be a p-wave qq state, so it has to be something else.attractive at medium and long distances:r v c (r) n c → ∞ limit with a light σ meson (2.6)on the other hand, if the σ(600) meson disappears from the spectrum for large n c , or if it becomes heavier than the lightest vector meson, then the dominant attractive force would become shorter-ranged than the repulsive force, and the net force at medium and long distances would be repulsive rather than attractive:r v c (r) n c → ∞ limit without the σ meson (2.7)in this scenario, at large n c the nuclear force is repulsive at all distances, and there are no bound nuclei at all, liquid or crystalline.so what really happens to the sigma-meson and to the nuclear forces at large n c ? the best way to settle this controversy would be to find the σ resonance and its mass in a lattice qcd calculation for several values of n c . such a calculation would require a realistic pion mass (unlike most present-day lattice calculations extrapolating from m π ≥ 350 mev) andrather large lattices to distinguish the sigma resonance from the two-pion continuum, so it may be too hard for the present-day computers. but thanks to the moore's law, finding the σ resonance on a lattice should become possible in a not-too-distant future.alternatively, we may try to resolve the issue using holography. although a holographic model of real qcd -or rather, of qcd with large n c -is yet to be constructed, several known models seem to be qualitatively similar, so we can compare their predictions for the meson spectra in general, and for the lightest true scalar meson in particular. however, the models that seem qualitatively similar to qcd may not be similar enough, and their predictions could be widely off target. indeed, the predictions of different models have turned out to be quite different from each other. for example, in the sakai-sugimoto model which we use in this article, the lightest true scalar meson is more than twice as heavy as the lightest vector meson. consequently -as we shall see in painful detail in section 5 -the net nuclear force is everywhere repulsive and looks like (2.7) rather than like (2.6). on the other hand, in the highly-non-antipodal version of the dymarsky-kuperstein-sonnenschein model [27], the lightest j cp = 0 ++ meson is much lighter than any other mesons (except the pions) [29]. however, this lightest scalar is a pseudo-goldstone boson of the approximate conformal symmetry of the flavor sector, so it is not clear how much attractive force it can mediate. as of this writing, it is not clear if the net nuclear potential in this model looks like the real-life potential (2.6) or like the everywhere-repulsive potential (2.7) we calculate in this paper for the sakai-sugimoto model. but suppose tomorrow somebody discovers a holographic model of the real qcd andmiracle of miracles -it has a realistic spectrum of mesons, including the σ(600) resonance, and even the realistic yukawa couplings of those mesons to the baryons. even for such a model, the two-body nuclear forces would not be quite as in the real world because the semi-classical holography limits n c → ∞, λ → ∞ suppress the multiple meson exchanges between baryons. although in this case, the culprit is not the large number of colors but the large 't hooft coupling λ = n c g 2 ym . indeed, from the hadronic point of view, nuclear forces arise from the mucleons exchanging one, two, or more mesons, and in real life the double-meson exchanges are just as important as the single-meson exchanges. in particular, since the lightest mesonic state with i g = 0 + , j cp = 0 ++ quantum numbers is a pair of un-bound pions, the longest-range isoscalar attractive force between nucleons comes from exchanges of two pions rather than of any single mesons. in holography, the single-meson exchanges happen at the tree level of the string theory while the multiple meson exchanges involve string loops (k − 1 loops for k mesons), and the loop amplitudes are suppressed by the powers of 1/λ relative to the tree amplitudes.naively, one would expect the loop amplitudes to carry additional factors of 1/n c (which is dual to the string coupling) rather than 1/λ, or maybe both 1/λ and 1/n c factors, but the naive power-of-n c counting does not work for loop amplitudes involving baryons made of n c quarks. 6 indeed, in honest qcd with a large number of colors, the multi-meson-exchange contributions to the non-relativistic effective potential for the baryons are not suppressed by powers of 1/n c [27]. however, the extra powers of n c due to n c quarks in a baryon are not accompanied by the extra powers of λ, so in holography, the contributions of the multiple meson exchanges are suppressed, albeit by powers of 1/λ rather than 1/n c .to see how this works in a general holographic model of qcd with n c ≫ n f , note that such a model starts with a string-theoretic construction where the colors and the flavors live on separate branes. for large n c and large λ, the color branes become black branes producing curvature and fluxes through the bulk, which provide a non-trivial background for degrees of freedom living in the bulk itself as well as on the flavor branes. the bulk degrees of freedom are dual to the pure-color sector of qcd (glueballs, etc.), while the vector and scalar fields living on the flavor branes are dual to the qq mesons. the flavor fields have rather weak couplings to each other: in 5d terms,g 5d,flavor ∼ √ r kk √ λn c (2.8)so the 4d mesons -which are modes of the 5d vector and scalar fields with wave functionsψ ∼ r −1/2kk -have couplings to each other of the orderg m m m ∼ 1 √ λn c . (2.9)a holographic baryon is made from some brane spanning only the compact dimensions that is connected to the flavor branes by n c strings, although this construction is often equivalent to an instanton of the 5d flavor gauge fields. consequently, the baryon-meson coupling is enhanced by an extra factor of n c ,g m bb ∼ n c × 1 √ λn c = √ n c √ λ . (2.10)at the tree level of the baryon-meson theory, scattering of two baryons proceeds through a single-meson exchange, which produces a o(n c /λ) amplitude,a tree ∼ g 2 m bb ∼ n c λ . (2.11)at the one-loop level, there are two types of diagrams, the triangle diagrams such asa ∆ ∼ g 3 m bb × g m m m ∼ n c λ 2 (2.12)and the box and crossed-box diagrams (2.13) with amplitudesa ∼ g 4 m bb ∼ n 2 c λ 2 . (2.14)that carry an extra power of n c . however, banerjee et al showed [27] that for non-relativistic baryons, the box and the crossed-box diagrams almost cancel each other from the effective potential between the baryons, with the un-canceled part having a lower power of the n c . banerjee et al did not pay any attention to the powers of λ, but clearly the un-canceled sub-leading terms in the box and crossed-box diagrams cannot carry higher powers of the 't hooft coupling than the leading terms (2.14), thusa uncanceled ∼ n c λ 2 ∼ a ∆ ∼ 1 λ a tree . (2.15)in other words, the contribution of the double-meson exchange and other one-loop processes to the 2-body nuclear potential carries the same power of n c but is suppressed by a factor 1/λ compared to the tree-level singe-meson exchange.to be precise, the large λ limit suppresses exchanges of the un-bound meson pairs but not of the meson-meson resonances -which become narrow (because of weak g m m m ) and act as single mesons exchanged between the two baryons. in particular, in the isoscalar 0 ++ channel that gives rise to the dominant attractive force between nucleons, the λ → ∞ limit suppresses the contribution of the unbound two-pion continuum, but it replaces it with a discrete set of f 0 resonances. in a good holographic model of qcd (which alas has not been found yet), the overall strength of the 0 ++ channel should be similar to the real qcd, so it would produce a similar isoscalar attractive force at short distances. however, the range of this attractive force would be significantly shorter: instead of decaying with distance like exp(−2m π r) as in real life, the holographic attractive force decays as exp(−m 0 r) where m 0 is the mass of the lightest isoscalar 0 ++ meson, presumably σ(600 mev).in principle, the isoscalar 1 −− channel that gives rise to the dominant repulsive force suffers from similar corrections in the λ → ∞ limit. but in practice, the strongest and the longest-range contribution to this channel comes from exchanges of a single ω(787) meson, so suppressing the multi-meson exchanges in this channel would not make a qualitative difference. thus altogether, the net effect of large 't hooft coupling on the central nuclear potential -besides the overall 1/λ factor -is the shortening of the attractive tail at long distances:r λ × v c (r)blue: real qcd, λ ∼ 1 red: best possibility for holographic qcd, λ ≫ 1 (2.16) however, this optimistic picture presumes a holographic model of qcd that correctly reproduces (a) the overall strength of the isoscalar 0 ++ and 1 −− channels, and (b) the mass spectra of vector and scalar mesons, especially the masses of the lightest 0 ++ and 1 −− mesons σ(600) and ω(787). but thus far, no known model satisfies these requirements, not even approximately, so the nuclear forces they produce could be much more different from the real life than (2.16). in particular, the nuclear force we calculate in this paper for the sakai-sugimoto model turns out to be everywhere repulsive:r v c (r)/n c blue: real qcd red: sakai-sugimoto model (2.17)now let's go back to the large n c limit -in holography or in honest qcd -and consider yet another general problem with baryons made from many quarks: how to separate the nucleons with i = j = 1 2 from the other kinds of baryons such as ∆ with i = j = 3 2 ? in real life, there is a large mass gap between the nucleons and the ∆ baryons -almost 300 mev -but for large n c this gap shrinks as 1/n c . at the same time, the two-baryon potential grows like n c , so for large n c it becomes stronger than the gap. consequently, two interacting nucleons may ""forget"" their individual spins and isospins and mix up with other baryonic species such as ∆. in fact, for large n c there is a whole lot of baryonic species with i = j ranging from 1 2 (for odd n c ) or 0 (for even n c ) all the way up to n c /2, and a strongly-interacting nucleon might mix up with all of them. while such mixing would not affect the isoscalar spin-blind central force between two baryons, it might significantly enhance the isovector spin-spin and tensor forces.therefore, comparing the two-baryon forces in the large n c limit to the real-life twonucleon forces is rather tricky. one has to carefully keep track of the spin and isospin degrees of freedom of the two baryons, expand the interaction hamiltonian into central, spinspin, and tensor forces as in eq. (2.3), and then compare the radial profiles a c (r), a s (r), and a t (r). moreover, the spin and isospin degrees of freedom require quantum mechanical treatment because semi-classically, we do not get definite spins or isospins even for standalone single baryons. instead, we get skyrmions, or instantons, or some other kind of solitons with a definite orientation of the su(2) isospin relative to the su(2) spin ; in quantum terms, they become superpositions of baryons with all possible i = j = 1 2 , 3 2 , . . . , ∞. consequently, a force between two such semiclassical baryons is not a force between two nucleons but rather a superposition of forces between different baryonic species.this problem affected the first holographic calculation of the nuclear forces by k. y. kim and i. zahed [30]. their baryons were semiclassical instantons in the sakai-sugimoto model, so instead of definite |i, i z , j, j z they had a definite direction n in s 3 = su(2) isospin × su(2) spin /su(2) common . consequently, kim and zahed [30] found that the force between two baryons depends on the angle between n 1 and n 2 -it was attractive for some angles and repulsive for other -but they could not interpret this angular dependence in terms of the isovector spin-spin and tensor forces. by comparison, hashimoto, sakai, and sugimoto [16] made a similar calculation using properly quantized collective coordinates for each instanton.consequently, they obtained the force between two nucleons rather than some mixed-up baryons, and they could see how this force depends on each nucleon's i z and j z . in particular, they saw that at medium-short distances, the net force between two nucleons is always repulsive. evidently, the attraction kim and zahed saw for some relative orientations of semiclassical baryons happens only for high spins and isospins, but not for nucleons withi = j = 1 2 .on the other hand, the analysis of hashimoto et al was limited to the first-order perturbation theory for nucleons that are far enough from each other to avoid the strong mixing of spins and isospins. this approach will not work for the hard-core region at very short distances where the interactions are much stronger than the gaps between states of the individual baryons. in the hard core, the semiclassical analysis of kim and zahed might work better than the perturbative expansion of hashimoto et al, although comparing the semi-classical large-n c results to the real-life nuclear forces might be problematic.to summarize, the large n c limit of nuclear physics suffers from three major problems. the third problem of baryon mixing is only technical, and it can be solved -at least for the medium and long distances between the nucleons -by following hashimoto et al rather than kim and zahed. but there are no ways around the first problem of different phase structures of nuclear matter with n c = 3 and with n c → ∞. even at high pressures and densities, there is a difference: for n c = 3, squeezing nucleons together makes them merge into a quark liquid, while for n c → ∞ the nucleons always retain their individual identities and a would-be quark liquid suffers from the ""chiral density wave"" instability [4]. it is possible that at some intermediate pressures and densities the n c = 3 nucleons form a crystal -just like helium solidifies at high pressures -before merging into a quark liquid. if this intermediate-pressure phase of real nuclear matter is ever observed in a lab, or can be reliably shown to exist in some exotic but observable places like inferiors of neutron stars, it would be very interesting to compare its properties to the holographic models. until then, we can only speculate.finally, the second problem -concerning the fate of the σ(600) resonance in the large n c limit and its effect on the attractive nuclear force -is solvable in principle, but it has not been solved yet. in holography, this problem is aggravated by using qcd-like models in lieu of the presently unknown holographic dual of the real qcd. the meson spectra of such models are not quite realistic; for example, in the sakai-sugimoto model (both antipodal and non-antipodal versions) there is no σ resonance and the lightest scalar meson has more than twice the mass of the lightest vector meson. consequently, we shall see in section 5 that in this model, the attractive force is both weaker and shorter-ranged than the repulsive force, so the net nuclear force is always repulsive. this could be a peculiar failing of the sakai-sugimoto model, or it could be the general problem of holography or even of the large n c limit. hopefully, future research will resolve this issue.",{},https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2621v2.pdf

(2020) observe that human annotators have a decent level of agreement in constructing the disambiguations in ambigqa, thereby supporting the observation that asqa is more objective than eli5.evaluation metrics second, we caveat that our accuracy metrics (str-em and disambig-f1) only measure the recall of the required information in the long answers. in cases where the long answer hallucinates incorrect disambiguations or facts, the accuracy metrics may still be high as long as the correct disambiguations are included. we note, however, that this unnecessary extra information may still be penalized by the rouge-l metric. moreover, in the presence of distractors, we also expect the accuracy of the roberta model used for reading comprehension to degrade, thereby effectively penalizing a low precision.on a separate note, the disambig-f1 metric requires a high-accuracy qa system. hence, for domains that are significantly different from wikipedia, fine-tuning the roberta squadv2 model on the task might be important to ensure the effectiveness of the disambig-f1 metric. and receive an answer within a day. to support this mechanism, we allowed annotators to ""park"" an annotation task they were unsure about and return to it after they have their concerns resolved.annotators' well-being for this study, we recruited annotators who were fully dedicated to our task (8 hours a day for 5 days a week). to reduce the pressure on annotators and allow them to work at a comfortable pace, we gave annotators one hour to answer each question and recommended answering ten or more questions per day. on average, it took annotators 15 minutes to answer each question with the time consumption slightly decreasing as annotators get familiar with the task. the compensation rate for the task was set to be $17.8/hour which is higher than the minimum hourly wage in the us.","{196170479: 'Fan et al. 2019', 52822214: 'Yang et al., 2018'}",https://www.aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.566.pdf

551,237420723,Towards Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation,research limitations,Insight-tree,"one potential threat to the validity in user studies like ours lies in the reliability of the study participants. given that we applied more than one quality-assurance measure-participant selection, an attention check, manual inspection-we are confident that our results are reliable. given also that most participants are fluent in english and regular movie watchers, we believe that the participants are representative at least for a subset of potential users of an online crs.another potential limitation is that we so far only analyzed two language generation systems. the question therefore remains to what extent the findings of our study would generalize to other approaches. since both analyzed systems (kbrd and kgsf) were published in the last two years, and since they were published at top-ranked scientific conferences, we believe that they are good representatives of the state-of-the-art in neural generation-based systems. moreover, an earlier analysis of the deepcrs system in [16] indicates that similar phenomena might be found also for other approaches. note also that our study can be easily extended to include alternative or even newer approaches, as long as the respective authors share the needed artifacts for reproducibility. as of now, we did not find any work that demonstrate superior quality than the kgsf system, and that the source code of such a system is available. to ensure replicability of our own work, we also share all the code and data used for our analyses online.so far, we analyzed our approach only with the help of the redial dataset. this choice was necessary to ensure a fair comparison with two recent works (kbrd and kgsf), which also relied on this dataset. recently, a number of alternative dataset was proposed, e.g., [5,14,65]. an evaluation of all compared methods on other datasets is however beyond the scope of our present work, which aimed to assess the relative performance of generation-based and retrievalbased system based on the dataset for which they were originally designed and tuned.regarding the general nature of the proposed crb-crs system, it is a retrieval-based system. however, as discussed in section 3, we also rely on a small set of heuristics in a few processing phases, which are, for example, implemented using keyword lists and string matching. these heuristics, which are not yet learned automatically, are documented in the provided source code of our system. automating the construction of these rules and keyword lists, e.g., based on movielens metadata, is a part of our future work to avoid any knowledge-engineering bottlenecks.",{52822214: '28]'},https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02311v1.pdf

553,247779047,Understanding Questions that Arise When Working with Business Documents,limitations and future work,Insight-tree,"in this work we focused only on word documents as a common document type where users can author, copy-edit, or read content. indeed, the organization where we deployed our studies primarily uses word for business documents. the focus on word rather than e.g., pdfs or web pages also allowed us to obtain questions about documents at various stages of development, not just finalized manuscripts. future work can investigate the types of questions that arise when users interact with other file types such as pdf, excel, and powerpoint. because each file type is used for different purposes (e.g., excel documents for long-term book-keeping [27]) and possibly containing content at different levels of abstraction, the extent to which question answering in these documents can be automated and the kinds of expertise knowledge workers need may be different from the word documents in our study.because all questions had to first pass through the knowledge workers' system, the majority of the responses that participants received from the q&a system had a delay. therefore, it is possible that participants would have asked different questions if the responses had been provided instantaneously. another property that could have conceivably impacted the types of questions users asked is the quality of the answers that they received. to understand if the types of questions by a user changed over time as they gained familiarity with the system, we examined the questions that were posted by the same user both across different documents or on the same document. we observed that some users posted multiple questions in succession and close together in time, e.g., in the span of a few minutes. although these users would realize that the system does not provide answers instantaneously, their cluster of initial questions would not be impacted by the expectation of a long delay, their perceived capabilities of the system, or the quality of the answers. in fact, although we had specified in the consent form that there may be a delay in the responses that participants would receive from the q&a system, some end-of-study survey responses indicated that a number of participants had in fact not noticed this point and had asked their first few questions expecting instantaneous answers-""i was initially confused by the delay of asking the question in the document and then waiting for an email that told me to go back to the document. it seemed a bit redundant to get an email about it vs. just a notification in the word doc itself and telling me it was working on it or something. for a plug-in, however, i would expect less of a delay. "" (p-2-18). therefore, the first few questions from these participants could help with the generalizability of our results.the delay or the quality of answers however, may have influenced those users who submitted questions after receiving answers from the system. upon examination, we found that in many instances, when users received answers to their previous questions, they explored increasingly more sophisticated questions of various types, e.g., content-related, concerning metadata, or seeking external information. for instance, one participant started by asking simple metadata questions (""who is the author?"") and proceeded to ask questions on a scanned document that needed not only complex reasoning, but also optical character recognition (ocr): ""what is the total score?"" on a document where handwritten scores were given to each question. this finding suggests that the answers may have in fact encouraged users to be liberal with the types of questions they wished to subsequently ask. this exploration could be due to users gaining confidence that the system can in fact handle the types of questions with which they need support or could be because they wished to test the limits of its abilities.nevertheless, the characterization that we present in the paper also includes the questions users submitted in the experience sampling phase, where participants could imagine a sophisticated system with any or no delay. the set of questions in that phase of the study could further help with generalizability of our results, e.g., to settings where not all questions necessarily experience a delay.it is conceivable that the types of questions about a document may vary with the document type. in phase 2 where we had access to the documents, we observed that the document distribution was in fact very varied and included project proposals and timelines, value propositions, design specifications, service instructions, management training, protocols, faqs, whitepaper reports, strategy planning, customer feedback, research findings, etc. from various domains. with this diverse set of document types, investigating the relationship between types of questions and types of documents would require collecting far more questions by running the study for a long time.the setup of our q&a system was such that users submitted one-shot questions as there were no affordances for following up on previously asked questions. future work should investigate whether the types of questions that users ask a document q&a system differ if the system provides the users with the means for following up on their previous questions or multi-round conversations with the assistant.another area for future work would be to explore the context of user needs including when users need different types of assistance with their documents, what they do before the seek help, and what they do after they receive answers. to minimize concerns about the confidentiality of the business data, the contextual information that we collected in our study concerned the metadata of the document (e.g., file size, last modified date, etc.) and not the content. for the same reason, we did not track a user's modification of the document before or after the user posted a question; the metadata was collected upon the user's submission of a question. therefore, given the data we collected, we cannot examine the context of user needs. future work can study this question through interviews and user-produced logs.","{86611921: '33,', 211010545: '[55,'}",https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15073v2.pdf

599,119104197,Transient dynamics of perturbations in astrophysical disks,conclusion,Insight-tree,"this review is devoted to the transient dynamics of perturbations, which is of special interest in theory of astrophysical disks, in particular accretion disks. exponentially growing perturbations do not exist in a homogeneous inviscid keplerian flow provided that there are no conditions for the magneto-rotational instability. nevertheless, observations suggest that also in this case angular momentum should be somehow transported outwards. at least, this implies that there should be some mechanism of energy transfer from the regular rotational motion to hydrodynamical perturbations. in spectrally stable flows the transient growth mechanism is responsible for this. here it was introduced by a simple example of two-dimensional vortices and it was discussed that the reason for their growth is the shortening of the length of leading spirals by the differential rotation of the flow (see fig. 2 and 3). nonwithstanding their seeming simplicity, those (quasi-)columnar structures exhibit the strongest ability to extract energy from the spectrally stable differentially rotating flows (see [54] about it). physically, the energy growth of vortices takes place due to their own angular momentum conservation, which in the local limit is expressed by the conservation of their potential vorticity and the existence of the invariant i (see section 2.2). here we considered both small-scale (k y ≫ 1) and large-scale (k y ≪ 1) vortices and compared their optimal growth with account for non-zero effective viscosity in the disk (see fig. 4). importantly, the transient growth of large-scale vortices strongly increases for a super-keplerian rotation, which can be significant in relativistic disks where q > 3/2. in this paper, special attention was paid to mathematical aspects of non-modal analysis and to methods of optimal perturbations computation. we have discussed in detail that the transient growth is a consequence of non-normality of the governing dynamical operator of the problem and non-orthogonality of its eigenvectors, i.e. modes of perturbations (see fig. 5 and 6). therefore, the growth of arbitrary perturbations can be adequately studied by calculating not eigenvectors but singular vectors of this operator. we have considered two methods: a matrix and variational one and applied them to the particular problems (see the corresponding results in fig. 7 and 11). the matrix method requires a discrete representation of the dynamical operator, for example, in the basis of its eigenvectors. the variational method is reduced to iterative integration of the system of direct and adjoint equations forward and backward in time, respectively. we have emphasized that the variational method is more universal and can be applied to study of non-modal dynamics of perturbations in non-stationary flows, as well as to non-linear problems.",{},https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.08897v1.pdf

601,6855746,RAPPOR: Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response,attack models and limitations,Insight-tree,"we consider three types of attackers with different capabilities for collecting rappor reports.the least powerful attacker has access to a single report from each user and is limited by one-time differential privacy level 1 on how much knowledge gain is possible. this attacker corresponds to an eavesdropper that has temporary ability to snoop on the users' reports.a windowed attacker is presumed to have access to one client's data over a well-defined period of time. this attacker, depending on the sophistication of her learning model, could learn more information about a user than the attacker of the first type. nevertheless, the improvement in her ability to violate privacy is strictly bounded by the longitudinal differential privacy guarantee of ∞. this more powerful attacker may correspond to an adversary such as a malicious cloud service employee, who may have temporary access to reports, or access to a time-bounded log of reports. the third type of attacker is assumed to have unlimited collection capabilities and can learn the permanent randomized response b with absolute certainty. because of the randomization performed to obtain b from b, she is also bounded by the privacy guarantee of ∞ and cannot improve upon this bound with more data collection. this corresponds to a worst-case adversary, but still one that doesn't have direct access to the true data values on the client.despite envisioning a completely local privacy model, one where users themselves release data in a privacy-preserving fashion, operators of rappor collections, however, can easily manipulate the process to learn more information than warranted by the nominal ∞. soliciting users to participate more than once in a particular collection results in multiple permanent randomized responses for each user and partially defeats the benefits of memoization. in the webcentric world, users use multiple accounts and multiple devices and can unknowingly participate multiple times, releasing more information than what they expected. this problem could be mitigated to some extent by running collections per account and sharing a common permanent randomized response. notice the role of the operator to ensure that such processes are in place and the required or assumed trust on the part of the user.it is likely that some attackers will aim to target specific users by isolating and analyzing reports from that user, or a small group of users that includes them. even so, some randomly-chosen users need not fear such attacks at all: with probability 1 2 f h , clients will generate a permanent randomized response b with all 0s at the positions of set bloom filter bits. since these clients are not contributing any useful information to the collection process, targeting them individually by an attacker is counter-productive. an attacker has nothing to learn about this particular user. also, for all users, at all times, there is plausible deniability proportional to the fraction of clients providing no information.in one particular attack scenario, imagine an attacker that is interested in learning whether a given client has a particular value v, whose population frequency is known to be fv. the strongest evidence in support of v comes in the form of both bloom filter bits for v being set in the client's report (if two hash functions are used). the attacker can formulate its target set by selecting all reports with these two bits set. however, this set will miss some clients with v and include other clients who did not report v. false discovery rate (fdr) is the proportion of clients in the target set who reported a value different from v. figure 7 shows fdr as a function of fv, the frequency of the string v. notably, for relatively rare values, most clients in the target set will, in fact, have a value that is different from v, which will hopefully deter any would-be attackers.the main reason for the high fdr rate at low frequencies fv stems from the limited evidence provided by the observed bits in support of v. this is clearly illustrated by figure 8 where the probability that v was reported (1) or not reported (0) by the client is plotted as a function of fv. for relatively rare strings (those with less than 10% frequency), even when both bits corresponding to v are set in the report, the probability of v being reported is much smaller than of value v given the two bits observed in a rappor report s corresponding to the two bits set by string v. for rare strings, even when both bits are set to 1 (green lines), it is still much more likely that the client did not report v, but some other value.it not being reported. because the prior probability fv is so small, a single client's reports cannot provide sufficient evidence in favor of v.",{},https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6981v2.pdf

700,247593883,REASONING OVER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DATA IN RETRIEVAL-BASED SYSTEMS,adapting existing benchmarks to privacy-preserving qa and limitations,Insight-tree,"we first adapt the widely used benchmark, hotpotqa [yang et al., 2018], to study our problem. hotpotqa contains multi-hop questions, which are each answerable by multiple wikipedia passages. we create hotpotqa-pair by splitting the wikipedia corpus into d g and d p by randomly assigning wikipedia articles to one or the other. this results in questions entirely reliant on p ∈ d p , entirely reliant on d ∈ d g , or reliant on a mix of one private and one public document, allowing us to evaluate performance under the pair constraints.ultimately however, d p and d g come from a single wikipedia distribution in hopotqa-pair. while it is possible that public and private data come from the same distribution (e.g., organizations routinely develop internal wikis in the style of public wikipedia), private and public data will intuitively often reflect different linguistic styles, structures, and topics, that further evolve over time [hawking, 2004]. we observe all existing textual multi-hop benchmarks focus on retrieving from a single distribution (table 1). additionally, we cannot combine existing benchmarks over two different corpora because this will not yield questions requiring one passage from each domain. methodologically, in the pair setting we likely will not have access to training data from all downstream (private) domains. to evaluate with a realistically private set of information and pair set up, we create a new benchmark concurrentqa. 6 following from the simple security property and *-property in the blp model. 7 single-hop can also avoid performance degradations arising from using two enclaves. recall that a non-private system retrieves the top k overall passages, so if for example kp = k 2 and kg = k 2 , such that kp + kg = k, the system may not retrieve the optimal k passages that the non-private system would have retrieved (e.g., consider when the overall top k passages for a question are in dg). however letting kp ∈ [0..k], kg ∈ [0..k] circumvents this challenge, at the cost of retrieving a few more passages per hop.","{189927857: ', Feldman and El-Yaniv, 2019', 52822214: 'Yang et al.

818,235790370,A Systematic Survey of Text Worlds as Embodied Natural Language Environments,contemporary limitations and challenges,Insight-tree,"environment complexity is limited, and it's currently difficult to author complex worlds. two competing needs are currently at odds: the desire for complex environments to learn complex skills, and the desire for environment variation to encourage robustness in models. current tooling emphasizes creating varied procedural environments, but those environments have limited complexity, and require agents to complete straightforward tasks. economically creating complex, interactive environments that simulate a significant fraction of real world interactions is still well beyond current simulators or libraries -but required for higher-fidelity interactive worlds that have multiple meaningful paths toward achieving task goals. generating these environments semi-automatically (e.g. ammanabrolu et al., 2020a) may offer a partial solution. independent of tooling, libraries and other middleware offer near-term solutions to more complex environment modeling, much in the same way 3d game engines are regularly coupled with physics engine middleware to dramatically reduce the time required to implement forces, collisions, lighting, and other physics-based modeling. currently, few analogs exist for text worlds. the addition of a chemistry engine that knows ice warmed above the freezing point will change to liquid water, or a generator engine that knows the sun is a source of sunlight during sunny days, or an observation engine that knows tools (like microscopes or thermometers) can change the observation model of a pomdp -may offer tractability in the form of modularization. efforts using large-scale crowdsourcing to construct knowledge bases of commonsense knowledge (e.g., atomic, sap et al., 2019) may be required to support these efforts.current planning languages offer a partial solution for environment modelling. while simulators partially implement facilities for world modeling, some (e.g. côté et al., 2018;shridhar et al., 2020b) suggest using mature planning languages like strips (fikes and nilsson, 1971) or pddl (mcdermott et al., 1998) for more full-featured modeling. this would not be without significant development effort -existing implementations of planning languages typically assume full-world observability (in conflict with pomdp modelling), and primarily agent-directed state-space changes, making complex world modeling with partial ob-servability, and complex environment processes (such as plants that require water and light to survive, or a sun that rises and sets causing different items to be observable in day versus night) outside the space of being easily implemented with off-the-shelf solutions. in the near-term, it is likely that a domain-specific language specific to complex text world modeling would be required to address these needs while simultaneously reducing the time investment and barrier-to-entry for end users.analyses of environment complexity can inform agent design and evaluation. text world articles frequently emphasize agent modeling contributions over environment, methodological, or analysis contributions -but these contributions are critical, especially in the early stages of this subfield. agent performance in easy environments has increased incrementally, while medium-to-hard environments have seen comparatively modest improvements. agent performance is typically reported as a distribution over a large number of environments, and the methodological groundwork required to understand when different models exceed others in time or performance over these environment distributions is critical to making forward progress. transfer learning in the form of training on one set of environments and testing on others has become a standard feature of benchmarks (e.g. hausknecht et al., 2020), but focused contributions that work to precisely characterize the limits of what can be learned from (for example) omniquest and transferred to zork, and what capacities must be learned elsewhere, will help inform research programs in agent modeling and environment design.transfer learning between text world and 3d environments. tasks learned at a high-level in text worlds help speed learning when those same models are transferred to more complex 3d environments (shridhar et al., 2020b). this framing of transfer learning may resemble how humans can converse about plans for future actions in locations remote from those eventual actions (as when we apply knowledge learned in classrooms to the real world). as such, text-plus-3d environment rendering shows promise as a manner of controlling for different sources of complexity in multi-modal task learning (from high-level task-specific knowledge to low-level perceptual knowledge), and appears a promising research methodology for imparting complex task knowledge on agents that are able to navigate high-fidelity virtual environments.","{52822214: 'Yang et al., 2018;'}",https://www.aclanthology.org/2022.wordplay-1.1.pdf

828,232307813,Local Interpretations for Explainable Natural Language Processing: A Survey,probe considerations and limitations.,Insight-tree,"the continued growth of probing-based papers has also led to recent work examining best practices for probes, and how to interpret their results. hewitt and liang [66] considered how to ensure that a probe is truly reflective of the underlying information present in a model, and proposed the use of a control task, a randomised version of a probe task in which high performance is only possible by memorisation of inputs. hence, a faithful probe should perform well on a probe task and poorly on a corresponding control task if the underlying model does indeed contain the information being probed for. the authors found that most probes (including linear classifiers)are over-parameterised, and discuss methods for constraining complex probes (e.g. multilayer perceptrons) to improve faithfulness while still allowing them to achieve similar results.while most papers we have discussed above follow the intuition that probes should avoid complex probes to prevent memorisation, pimentel et al. [127] suggest that instead the probe with the best score on a given task should be chosen as the tightest estimate, since simpler models may simply be unable to extract the linguistic information present in a model, and such linguistic information cannot be 'added' by more complex probes (since their only input are hidden representations). in addition, the authors argue that memorisation is an important part of linguistic competence, and as such probes should not be artificially punished (via control tasks) for doing this. recent work has also presented methods that avoid making assumptions about probe complexity, such as mdl probing [101,170], which directly measures 'amount of effort' needed to achieve some extraction task, or directprobe [198], which directly examines intermediate representations of models to avoid having to deal with additional classifiers.finally, hall maudslay et al. [59] compared the structural probe [67] with a lightweight dependency parser (both given the same inputs), and demonstrate that the parser is generally able to extract more syntactic information from bert embedding. in contrast, the probe performs better with a different metric, showing that the choice of metric is important for probes: when testing for evidence of linguistic information, one should not only consider the nature of the probe, but also the metric used to evaluate it. furthermore, the significance of well-performing probes is not clear: models may encode linguistic information not actually used by the end-task [138], showing that the presence of linguistic information does not imply it is being used for prediction. more causal approaches such as amnesiac probing [50], which directly intervene in the underlying model's representations, may better distinguish between these cases.","{236459873: '3', 237502773: '71]', 207870753: '165]', 237258250: '[177]', 225068329: '[178]'}",https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11072v2.pdf

945,261276512,Large Language Models on the Chessboard: A Study on ChatGPT's Formal Language Comprehension and Complex Reasoning Skills,conclusion,Insight-tree,"in summary, our investigation reveals that despite its exceptional capabilities in natural language processing, chatgpt faces considerable challenges with complex reasoning tasks involving formal language, as evidenced by its chess gameplay performance. the model's attention mechanism exhibits limitations in adequately recognizing tokens used in formal language, resulting in a suboptimal understanding of the game board. interestingly, our findings indicate that consistent repetition of relevant information throughout a conversation can partially alleviate this limitation. yet, despite chat-gpt's capacity to learn and internalize rules, the model struggles with self-regulation, which neither in-prompt instructions nor improved board comprehension appear to enhance. additionally, we find that the model's decision-making focus, or ""intent,"" can be strengthened by allowing nl reasoning, providing nl chessboard descriptions or enabling a clearer representation of the game board. future research could examine how this disproportionate attention allocation impacts other tasks that involve formal language and necessitate complex cognitive processing. in conclusion, while chatgpt stands as a remarkable advancement in artificial intelligence, it continues to face significant limitations, especially in nonlinguistic contexts. these findings highlight the necessity for further refinement before chatgpt, and models of its kind, can be considered reliable tools for practical applications requiring complex cognition akin to human abilities.

955,251224058,Efficient Long-Text Understanding with Short-Text Models,limitations,Insight-tree,"we present sled as a simple and effective method to extend the capabilities of pretrained short-text models to long-text tasks. despite its impressive empirical performance on scrolls, sled suffers from two disadvantages which may limit its applicability to some long-range tasks.long output to obtain linear complexity, sled assumes the output length k is constant. this is since the decoder uses quadratic selfattention over the output, on top of o(nk) crossattention between the output and input. while most current long-text tasks follow this assumption, future tasks, such as academic reports or script writing, may require long text generation. this limitation is not unique to sled and affects other long-range transformers including longt5 and led. aside from finetuning, this also affects pretraining models on long inputs with selfsupervised losses such as span-corruption (raffel et al., 2020b) or denoising (lewis et al., 2020), which require the decoder to process an output that is linear in the length of the input.co-reference resolution and fact retention an assumption at the heart of sled is the locality of information assumption. when the input text is long, this assumption may break if distant entity resolution or factual knowledge are required. for example, a chapter in a book may mention ""they were walking into the room"" when knowledge of what room or who walked is located a few chapters back. in such cases, the encoder used by sled will not be able to access this information, moving more responsibility to the decoder and reducing the effectiveness of the contextual encoding. similarly, in multi-hop questions (yang et al., 2018), attending to one part of the context is necessary in order to fully understand the question and encode a second piece of information correctly. as the encoder will not have access to the first context that leads to better question understanding, here as well more responsibility is delegated to the decoder.","{189927896: 'Jiang and Bansal, 2019', 226281978: 'Tay et al., 2021', 52822214: 'Yang et al., 2018', 220831004: 'Zaheer et al., 2020b'}",https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00748v3.pdf

1018,254854519,Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations,limitations & future work,Insight-tree,"model capabilities we observed that current lms struggle to generate several categories of examples. lms struggled to generate examples related to concepts they do not understand well (e.g. cryptography and steganography). as discussed in §6, we also found that lms struggled to generate examples with many constraints, in particular, those in the bbq dataset (parrish et al., 2022). we expect these limitations to wane as lms grow more capable with scale. lastly, many evaluations related to lm capabilities require the dataset creator to know how to solve the evaluation. we expect that lms will not be able to generate high-quality evaluations of this kind (e.g., to test for factual knowledge they do not yet know). our approach is thus differentially useful for evaluating other properties of models aside from capabilities (e.g., safety-related behaviors).model biases lms learn biases from their training data (sheng et al., 2019;gehman et al., 2020;brown et al., 2020), impacting the generator p g and discriminator p d . for example, generated evaluations may exhibit gender or racial biases and be lower quality for languages under-represented in the lm training data. lms will also be systematically worse at generating evaluations for tasks that are omitted from their training data (e.g., due to copyright, licensing, or privacy issues).example diversity we found limited example diversity for some kinds of evaluations ( §3.4) though not all ( §5). diversity appears to depends on the kind of evaluation generated, the generation hyperparameters, and the prompt used, and thus sometimes requires e.g. hyperparameter tuning to get right.we found data visualizations to be powerful tools for understanding and debugging data diversity, such as those at evals.anthropic.com/model-written/. qualitatively, we also found that using p d to rank/filter examples limited the diversity, since p d sometimes selected for prototypical examples for testing some behavior (observed qualitatively by workers in §3.2). we are excited for future work to explore other methods that achieve similar example quality with higher diversity than our method, such as generating many examples and subsampling for diversity.instructions may be misunderstood lms, similar to crowdworkers, may generate evaluations that are testing something different than intended, especially if the generation instructions are underspecified. for example, using the method in §3.1, we generated statements that a person who ""shares beliefs with derek parfit"" (the influential analytic philosopher) would agree or disagree with. the ""disagree"" statements were often ones that many people, not just derek parfit, would disagree with (""i support slavery"" or ""i believe evolution never happend""). in this case, we should have provided more specific instructions to the lm, to have it generate examples that derek parfit would disagree with but that another philosopher would agree with. when feasible, we recommend briefly examining the generated data, to catch salient issues such as the above.sensitivity to instructions our approach allows the dataset developer fairly fine-grained control over the evaluation by using instructions to guide p g . however, the quality of lm outputs is sensitive to text inputs in unintuitive ways (perez et al., 2021;lu et al., 2022), adding hard-to-predict variance to the quality of the resulting evaluation; see appendix §a.4 for a possible example of this effect we found. we hope that lm advances such as instruction-tuning (wei et al., 2021;sanh et al., 2022;ouyang et al., 2022) mitigate this issue in the future. for now, it may be possible to use prompt sensitivity to generate more diverse datasets, by generating similar datasets with distinct prompts and combining the results, as we did in §3. where prompt sensitivity caused issues, we found it helpful to be able to view example generated outputs in seconds, to quickly iterate and catch salient failures. for the 133 datasets in §3, we found a general instruction template that worked well; we did not do dataset-specific tuning to obtain samples rated as high-quality by human evaluators.",,https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09251v1.pdf
